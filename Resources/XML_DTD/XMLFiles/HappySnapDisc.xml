        <Text>Tommy, they’re actually using Discord, not Snapchat. That’s where all the action happens!</Text>

        <Text>No way! It’s gotta be Snapchat. I mean, can you imagine them snapping their code to each other? It’s too funny!</Text>

        <Text>It’s not Snapchat, though! They’re on Discord—sending code files, creating channels, all that. It’s way more practical.</Text>

        <Text>I mean, it would be weird... if they were using Snapchat. But they’re not. They’re using Discord. You’re mixing it up!</Text>
