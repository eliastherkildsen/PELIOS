        <Text>Hey Frank, I hear you, but you know what? I think SQL could also work really well. It’s so reliable for structured data, and our students will get solid hands-on practice!</Text>

        <Text>That’s a fair point! Though with NoSQL, they’ll get to see how schema-less designs work and handle massive scaling. That’s exciting for them, right?</Text>

        <Text>You know what, maybe we can mix it up! We could even show them both approaches during the semester! That way they get the best of both worlds!</Text>
