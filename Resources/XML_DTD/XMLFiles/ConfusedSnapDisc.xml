        <Text>Frank, I just don't get it. How are these kids sharing their code on Snapchat? It doesn't even seem like a place you'd do that.</Text>

        <Text>Tommy, they're not using Snapchat. It's Discord—way more fitting for code sharing with channels and text formatting.</Text>

        <Text>But... wait, Discord? No, no, I could’ve sworn I heard them say Snapchat. Why would they use Discord?</Text>

        <User>Frank</User>
        <Text>Because Discord's built for this kind of stuff. You can share files, code snippets, and have discussions. Snapchat doesn’t even have a setup for that.</Text>

        <Text>Yeah, but... how are they organizing all this on Snapchat? I really don’t understand how it works for code.</Text>

        <Text>They're not using Snapchat! It’s definitely Discord, Tommy. That’s why it makes sense.</Text>

        <Text>I don't know, Frank... I could be missing something, but Snapchat still feels like the answer somehow.</Text>
