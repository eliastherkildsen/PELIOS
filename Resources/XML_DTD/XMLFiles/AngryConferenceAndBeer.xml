        <Text>Hey, don’t look at me! I thought you were fine with it. Why didn’t you say anything earlier?</Text>

        <Text>Because I didn’t think we’d have this problem again! I wanted some space this year. This is ridiculous!</Text>

        <Text>Oh, come on! Don’t tell me you’re going to sulk the entire time just because we’re sharing a room. Grow up, Frank!</Text>

        <Text>This isn’t about "sulking." I wanted a break, some space, and now it’s just a mess. I’m not looking forward to this at all anymore.</Text>

        <Text>Fine! Let’s just get through the conference, have a couple of beers, and try to survive sharing the room, okay?</Text>
