        <Text>Tommy, I don’t understand why you're so stuck on SQL! This project clearly needs NoSQL's flexibility, but you keep pushing this outdated, rigid system!</Text>

        <Text>Outdated? Are you kidding me? SQL is a cornerstone of database systems, Frank! You can't just throw it aside because you’re obsessed with the latest trends!</Text>

        <Text>It's not about trends, it’s about practicality! NoSQL can handle unstructured data so much better, and you're ignoring that just because you’re too comfortable with SQL!</Text>

        <Text>I’m not comfortable—I’m realistic! SQL is proven, stable, and perfect for the kind of structured data we’re dealing with. Why risk an unstable system?</Text>

        <Text>Stable? It’s restrictive! We’re never going to innovate if we keep using the same old methods!</Text>

        <Text>This isn't about innovation for the sake of it, Frank. It’s about choosing the right tool for the job!</Text>
