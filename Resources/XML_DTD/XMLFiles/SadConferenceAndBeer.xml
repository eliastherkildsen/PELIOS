        <Text>Tommy, I just realized... this conference might not be as fun as last year. It feels different this time.</Text>

        <Text>Yeah, I get what you mean, Frank. I was looking forward to it, but now it feels like something’s missing.</Text>

        <Text>Maybe it’s because we’re sharing a room again, but I don’t know... I’m not as excited about it.</Text>

        <Text>Same here. Last year, it felt like such a great time, but now I’m just not sure. Even the idea of grabbing beers doesn’t seem as exciting.</Text>

        <Text>I was thinking the same. I thought the local brews would cheer me up, but it’s just not the same vibe.</Text>

        <Text>Yeah... I don’t know if it’s the sessions or just the feeling of it all. It’s hard to look forward to it like before.</Text>

        <Text>We’ll still go, but I guess we’ll just have to see how it goes. Hopefully, it’s not as dull as we’re expecting.</Text>

        <Text>Yeah, maybe things will turn around when we’re there. But for now, I’m not too hopeful.</Text>
